# Disease Diagnosis Predictive Modeling

## Project Overview

Healthcare professionals often rely on diagnostic tests and biomarkers to assess individuals' health status and diagnose diseases. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into diseased or non-diseased categories based on their health attributes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the goal is to create a reliable tool that healthcare providers can use to assist in disease diagnosis and prognosis.

## Data Description

The dataset contains multiple health-related attributes, including cholesterol levels, blood cell counts, hormone levels, and other physiological measurements. Each instance in the dataset is labeled with information on whether the individual has been diagnosed with a specific disease or not.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of an individual having a specific disease based on their health attributes. The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Outcome

The ultimate goal is to develop a robust predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in early disease detection and patient management. By accurately identifying individuals at risk of certain diseases, interventions can be initiated promptly, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Results

The Random Forest model achieved the following metrics:
- Accuracy: 97.18%
- Precision: 97.28%
- Recall: 97.18%
- F1 Score: 97.18%

## Conclusion

The developed predictive model shows promising results in accurately classifying individuals into diseased or non-diseased categories based on their health attributes. This tool has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in disease diagnosis and patient management, leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
